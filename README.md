# Ignore Escape for Selected Windows

This Foundry VTT module prevents specific windows from closing when the **Escape** key is pressed. It's something I made for my own use; I pop out all my player's cameras, so hitting escape kept kicking me from the livekit call. This is my first ever foundry module, so feel free to give me any feedback you may have! 

By default, it protects **Camera Popouts**, but I'm still considering adding some extra features as listed below:
## Features
- Prevents ESC from closing selected windows.  
- Configurable through **Module Settings → Ignore Escape → Configure**.  
- Choose from common window types via checkboxes.  
- Add custom class names for any other windows.

## Installation
1. Copy this manifest url: https://github.com/Dospoint0/escapeR/releases/latest/download/module.json
2. Paste it into foundry's module installation page.
3. You're done!

## Usage
- Open a protected window (e.g., Camera Popout).  
- Press **Esc** → window stays open.  
- Use the window’s **X button** to close it manually.
